## 🔧 Phase 1: Critical Database Schema Fixes

### ✅ Database Schema Enhancements
- **Added missing columns to orders table**:
  - `amount_paid` DECIMAL(10,2) - Payment tracking
  - `discount_amount` DECIMAL(10,2) - Discount calculations  
  - `tax_amount` DECIMAL(10,2) - Tax calculations
  - `shipping_amount` DECIMAL(10,2) - Shipping costs
- **Added email column to customers table**: Support for customer email addresses
- **Created order_payments table**: Comprehensive payment history tracking with foreign key constraints
- **Database indexes verified**: All performance indexes already in place

**Impact**: Eliminated SQL errors, enabled payment tracking, and improved database performance.

## 🛡️ Phase 2: Error Handling Framework

### ✅ Standardized Error Handling System
- **Enhanced base Controller class** with error handling helpers:
  - `handleDatabaseOperation()` - Wraps database calls in try-catch blocks
  - `setError()` & `setSuccess()` - Standardized user messaging
  - `handleException()` - Centralized exception handling with logging
  - `validateAndSanitize()` - Combined validation and sanitization
- **Updated all controllers** with proper error handling:
  - OrderController: Store, update, delete, status operations
  - CustomerController: CRUD operations with duplicate checking
  - UserController: User management operations
- **Graceful error recovery**: User-friendly messages with technical logging

**Impact**: Improved system reliability, better user experience, and comprehensive error logging.

## 📄 Phase 3: Pagination System

### ✅ High-Performance Pagination Implementation
- **Extended base Model class** with pagination methods:
  - `paginate()` - Standard pagination with conditions and ordering
  - `searchAndPaginate()` - Combined search and pagination functionality
- **Enhanced base Controller class** with pagination UI helpers:
  - `renderPagination()` - Bootstrap-compatible pagination controls
  - `buildPaginationUrl()` - URL generation with search parameters
  - `renderPaginationInfo()` - Result count displays
- **Implemented across all major views**:
  - **Customer Management**: 20 records per page with search by name, company, phone, email
  - **Order Management**: 20 records per page with search by notes and customer info
  - **Production Dashboard**: 50 records per page optimized for factory floor use

### 🔍 Search Functionality
- Real-time server-side search across multiple fields
- Search term preservation across pagination
- Clear search functionality
- Search result counts and indicators

**Impact**: Dramatically improved performance for large datasets, better user experience, and scalable architecture.
